Types of cubes and whether I can solve:
Currently, I am able to solve the pyraminx duo, however, it takes quite a long time and I am not very efficient. I am working towards solving the pyraminx and potentially other more complex cubes.

I am also working on learning to solve the pyraminx, although I am not able to completely solve it quite yet. Howevever, I am getting closer and am defintely improving as I learn what to look for when solving.
