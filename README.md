## **Types of cubes and whether I can solve:**
###### Date: September 20, 2021
Currently, I am able to solve the _pyraminx duo_, however, it takes quite a long time and I am not very efficient. I am working towards solving the pyraminx and potentially other more complex cubes.

I am also working on learning to solve the pyraminx, although I am not really able to get very far.

#### Averages: Pyraminx Duo
###### Calculated by removing best and worst times and averaging the rest

<ol> 
  <li>Average of 5: 58.802 </li>
  <li>Average of 12: 57.482 </li>
  <li>Average of 25: 59.847 </li>
  
## Update: September 27
I am getting closer to solving the pyraminx by getting more pieces in. I am finding it difficult to know how to even begin solving. I tend to just start twisting and see what happens, but I need to look for a more systematic approach.

## Update: October 25, 2021
I have been able to improve my pyraminx duo times quite a bit since September, but I haven't been able to log times for the pyraminx as I have not yet been able to finish it yet. I am getting closer by completing more of each side, but I still am not able to completely finish it. However, I think I have been making really good progress, and I know it won't be long before I'll be able to solve it.

## Update: October 26, 2021
  <ul>
    <li>I am able to solve 1 side of the pyraminx, after a **LONG** time! I was able to get the pyraminx to the stage of having one incorrect block per side.</li>
    <li>I am also getting better at determining which side should be which colour on the pyraminx.</li>
